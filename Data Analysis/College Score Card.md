This is one of my class assignments
The goal of this assignment was to gain experience using the Jupyter programming environment (including Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib) to do data analysis relating to a large government dataset. One of the main benefits to using Jupyter for data analysis is that it shows the exact steps of how I reached my conclusions. In this I will be analyzing data from the federal government's College Scorecard.
