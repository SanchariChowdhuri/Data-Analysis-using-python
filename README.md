#Data Analysis

This folder contains code and report for an analysis which was conducted on a large govt dataset as a part of class assignment. Libraries in Python like Pandas and Matplotlib are used to do data journalism relating to a large government dataset. One of the main benefits to using Jupyter for data journalism is that these conclusive steps are replicable . In this assignment I have analyzed data from the federal government's College Scorecard.(https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)



#Automated News  text generation from a dataset


This folder contains code and a template that can produce stories automatically that can contribute to ongoing coverage of the issue of fatal shootings by police officers in the US. The code and text which comes as an output from the code will take data from the Washington Post Fatal Police Shooting database and output a written story describing an overview, specifics of a single row of data, and any additional context. The story written is distinct based on the row of data input and also be put in context of the entire dataset, and use conditional logic to alter the story text based on data values. Each row of data produces a variant of the story (though there will obviously be some commonalities as well). Each story is at least 250 words long.

Features of the code:
-Numerous derived or aggregated data columns are created from the dataset that enhance the story (e.g. averages, trends, counts etc).
-Synonym sets (synsets) are used to add variability to the writing.
-Other general context through research is introduced and contextualized through the issue.
-Some variabilities are introduced in the stories produced for different rows of data.

 Jinja template engine along with filters and conditional logic is applied to the template.
