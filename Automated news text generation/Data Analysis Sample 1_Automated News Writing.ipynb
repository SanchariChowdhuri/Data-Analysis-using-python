    "\n",
    "### Working of the algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm will take data from the Washington Post Fatal Police Shooting database (Dataset2.csv),perform entry specific analysis on it and output a written story describing an overview, specifics of a single row of data, and any additional context. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "-The story produced by this algorithm is distinct based on the row of data input  also based on the context of the entire dataset, there is use of conditional logic to alter the story text based on data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Each row of data produces a variant of the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The story written by this algorithm includes aspects of an overview of the data set, as well as specifics about the row of data. \n",

The victim's race was identified as Hispanic. According to local police reports  Daniel Brumley was possessing a knife. The victim was reported to be  not fleeing .There was a certain level of threat associated with the victim .The average age of  these shooting victims in Texas is around 35.5 years.Since 1st January 2015 a total of 180 such incidents have taken place in Texas.The percentage of male victims among these 180 shootings is 96.1 percent in Texas.The percentage of victims who are hispanics is 28.89 percentage.3 such incidents have taken place on this date all over USA.Terence Walker was shot in Oklahoma and Pablo Meza was shot in California and Daniel Brumley was shot in Texas.The city of Fort Worth has witnessed 7 such shootings .States like California, Texas and Florida have very high occurrence of such police shootings.The shooting statistics in Texas puts this state among very high range of shooting occurences.Among all the 1954 police shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shot and killed a civilian in US 89.2 of the police officers were not wearing a body camera. .The absence of body camera makes it very difficult to determine the reason for the shooting and hence doesn't lend credibility to the entire situation and adds it as random acts of violence.\n"
